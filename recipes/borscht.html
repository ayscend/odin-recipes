    <h2>What is Borscht?</h2>

    <p>Borscht is a traditional slavic dish originating from
        Ukraine, and it is famous for it's vibrant red color.
        This red color comes from beetroots, and can actually be eaten cold and hot.
        The word borscht has a 't' at the end of it but you just call it borsch. This recipe, however,
        is packed with vitamins so stay tuned for the ingredients.
        <br>Now when it comes to soup it's hard to mess it up. Cut your veggies all bite-sized and don't worry about
        measurements too much. Meat is optional but it does make a difference in flavor. Sour cream is optional too 
        but it is traditionally added with a serving.
